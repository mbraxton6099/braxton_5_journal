        <p>
            I could use candy canes to hide waldo. Waldos with faces of other people, hide him on a webpage.I could use different objects instead of a waldo. Find the black saxophone in the bass clarinets. Use the class picture of a school and replace the pictures. Make a i spy picture and have the item hidden in the picture.
