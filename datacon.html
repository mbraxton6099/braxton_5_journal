<div id="section" class="special" style="color:#6FEA43; display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; "><p class="part1">DATA is a magnet school nestled within the Roosevelt campus. 

Here, students with an interest in animation, engineering, and art have a chance to develop important skills necessary for the jobs they hope to pursue in that field.

Being a magnet program, DATA is naturally smaller than most high schools, providing students with a less threatening environment, with teachers who can actually keep track of and monitor their students' progress.</p>

<p class="part1">Our close-knittedness allows students to get to know each other better and develop import social and teamwork skills, as well as providing fun opportunities for students such as field trips and such. As a DATA student myself, I could go on and on about the perks of being a DATA

student, but alas, I'm simply the webpage designer. However, there are more stories to be heard! Down below are three stories from three DATA freshman this year. Take a read and see if you connect with any of them, then continue looking around and have a great day at DATACON!</p></div>
