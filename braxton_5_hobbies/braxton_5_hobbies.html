                        <center><p>The Roosevelt Band is one of the best things I feel I've been commited to. You get pushed to work hard and no person is left behind. Each and every single person cares. The directors take care of you and push you to succeed. In the end each person works hard each and every single moment. After a contest we don't complain if we don't win anything. We look at where we started and what we came to. As said by everyone in band, "GO BAND!"</p></center>
