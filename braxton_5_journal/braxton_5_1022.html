        <p>The main problem was adjusting pictures and working with titles as well as sections.</p>
        <p>I found that i could make two section classes and itll make the different sections. 
        </p>
        <h1>I've learned that its much of trial and error. Also if a picture has a width a certian amount the section/ div should match the width and height.</h1>
