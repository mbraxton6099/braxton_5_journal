<p>If I were to be explaining this to a child then I would tell them that an html is like a story. You write about all different types of "characters". Then you use css to describe the characters, it's almost as a background info page</p>
<p>html is a place where you make a page and when you write it. Its shown on your page. CSS is the describing page when you tell what you want your page to look like. Divs are the sperating of the body of the page.IDs are the specific description in the css. Classes are the specifications in the css that tell the html that one is different from another.You can use all these to tell the html that the boxes need to move or not move and the color and the need for the size as well and where it is on the page.</p>
    <p>CSS animations can have moving objects, changing colors in background.</p>
<p> transistions are things taht change in the page when you hover over them with your mouse. Can move, change color. You control the way it looks and timing</p
